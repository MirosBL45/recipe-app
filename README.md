Hello :)

This is some kind of recipe-app done in ReactJS :)

DB of recipes from spoonacular.com

This mini-project I found on developedbyed YouTube channel,
and it was interesting to me, so I did it

Also, I used style from "styled-components" which was very attractive for me, but they don't give "normal" class names for HTML elements. The class-names are generated by MurmurHash algorithm. We make them easier to identify with babel-plugin-styled-components and the custom babel configuration.

Interesting artical about all that: https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-control-class-names-in-styled-components-72ed4b165cb9

Any advice is wellcome :)
